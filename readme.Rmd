#Synopsis
Vitamin C can affect the tooth growth. In this report we compare the effect of different doses of vitamin C, delivered in two methods on the tooth growth of guinea pigs. The sample are 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received 0.5, 1 or 2 mg/day vitamin C in the form of orange juice or ascorbic acid. 

The study is done on the ToothGrowth dataset in R. The dataset contains 60 rows and 3 columns. Columns are "len", "supp" and dose which indicate the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth), supplement method ("OG" for orange juice and "VC" for ascorbic acid) and the daily dose, respectively.
